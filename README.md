# Kebo Website

This is a one-page placeholder site, used as a holding page while I change the direction of Kebo.

Kebo has morphed from a web agency, host and plugin shop over the years, never quite settling into any. Now my own work path is taking me else where I intend to morph Kebo into my own personal plugin repository.

## What Next?

This website is designed to serve as a notice of the above intention and to act as a placeholder until I have finished the new version of the website. Idealy it will be replaced soon and this repo will be archived.

## What About The Plugins/Services?

I currently plan to make updates to all the plugins (although the Twitter Feed should be replaced by Social), the approach of Gutenberg makes that worth while. I still need to nail down exactly what I can/cannot merge from my plans for the Social plugin as I will need to fund the server infrastructure myself and not everything will be viable under that model. All the people who used services linked to the domain/site have been informed and moved, anyone with questions knows how to contact me.

## Thanks

My thanks to everyone who has used Kebo services at any time, I thoroughly enjoy making people happy and seeing how you use things which I create/provide. Special thanks to Luke Ketley (the KE in Kebo) for helping to start the journey.
